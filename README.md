# Calculator-Aplication-in-C-language
This is my first project in 1st year of my university( Jahangirnagar University )<br>
<br>In the below section , I will explain some feature of my Calculator Application project that I done by C language.
<br>
<br>Calculator Application
<br>This is a C-based console application that provides a variety of mathematical operations and calculations. The application features a menu-driven interface, <br>allowing users to choose from several mathematical functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equation solving, miscellaneous <br>calculations, and statistics.

Features:
1. Main Menu<br>
<br>Navigate to different mathematical operations.
<br>Options include:
<br>Addition
<br>Subtraction
<br>Division
<br>Multiplication
<br>Equation Solving
<br>Miscellaneous Calculations (Area Calculator, Age Calculator, Statistics)

<br>2. Addition
<br>Simple Addition: Add two numbers.
<br>Advanced Addition: Add multiple numbers.
<br>Matrix Addition: Add two matrices of the same dimension.

<br><br>3. Subtraction
<br>Simple Subtraction: Subtract two numbers.
<br>Absolute Difference: Get the absolute difference between two numbers.
<br>
<br>4. Division
<br>Simple Division: Divide two numbers.
<br>Advanced Division: Divide two numbers with a remainder.
<br>
<br>5. Multiplication
<br>Simple Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
<br>Modulo Multiplication: Multiply two numbers with a modulus.
<br>Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices.
<br>Exponentiation: Calculate the power of a number with a modulus.
<br>
<br>6. Equation Solving
<br>Simple Equation: Solve two linear equations with two variables.
<br>Complex Equation: Solve quadratic equations.
<br>
<br>7. Miscellaneous Calculations
<br>Area Calculator: Calculate the area of different shapes (Triangle, Rectangle, Circle, Trapezium).
<br>Age Calculator: Calculate the difference between two dates.
<br>Statistics: Calculate statistical measures such as mean, variance, median, and more.
<br>
<br>8. Error Handling
<br>Invalid Input: Prompts the user when an invalid input is detected.
<br>
<br>9. Exit
<br>The application can be exited from any menu by returning to the main menu.
