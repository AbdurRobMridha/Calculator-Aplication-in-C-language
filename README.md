# Calculator-Aplication-in-C-language
This is my first project in 1st year of my university( Jahangirnagar University )
In the below section , I will explain some feature of my Calculator Application project that I done by C language.

Calculator Application
This is a C-based console application that provides a variety of mathematical operations and calculations. The application features a menu-driven interface, allowing users to choose from several mathematical functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equation solving, miscellaneous calculations, and statistics.

Features:
1. Main Menu
Navigate to different mathematical operations.
Options include:
Addition
Subtraction
Division
Multiplication
Equation Solving
Miscellaneous Calculations (Area Calculator, Age Calculator, Statistics)

2. Addition
Simple Addition: Add two numbers.
Advanced Addition: Add multiple numbers.
Matrix Addition: Add two matrices of the same dimension.

3. Subtraction
Simple Subtraction: Subtract two numbers.
Absolute Difference: Get the absolute difference between two numbers.

4. Division
Simple Division: Divide two numbers.
Advanced Division: Divide two numbers with a remainder.

5. Multiplication
Simple Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.
Modulo Multiplication: Multiply two numbers with a modulus.
Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two matrices.
Exponentiation: Calculate the power of a number with a modulus.

6. Equation Solving
Simple Equation: Solve two linear equations with two variables.
Complex Equation: Solve quadratic equations.

7. Miscellaneous Calculations
Area Calculator: Calculate the area of different shapes (Triangle, Rectangle, Circle, Trapezium).
Age Calculator: Calculate the difference between two dates.
Statistics: Calculate statistical measures such as mean, variance, median, and more.

8. Error Handling
Invalid Input: Prompts the user when an invalid input is detected.

9. Exit
